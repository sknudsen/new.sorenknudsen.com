## Current Bachelor or Masters students
For inspiration for course projects (7.5 ECTS), Bachelor thesis projects (15 ETCS), and Master thesis projects (30 ECTS), please see [project inspiration](https://github.itu.dk/pages/soekn/sorenknudsen.com-restricted/project-inspiration) (use your ITU credentials to gain access).
